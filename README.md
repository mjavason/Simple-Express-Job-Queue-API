# Simple-Express-Job-Queue-API

Simple API that uses BullMQ for Redis-based job queues. It is the current standard for Node.js ecosystems, including Express.js. Built on Redis Streams, supports rate limiting, repeatable jobs, concurrency, event handling, and persistence.

   ```

**Running the project**

There are four main scripts defined in this project's `package.json` file:

- **npm run dev**

  - This script is used for development purposes. It will start a development server and enable hot reloading.

- **npm run build**

  - This script is used to build the project for production. It will bundle your code, minify files, and store them in a 'build' folder.

- **npm run start**

  - This script starts the application in production mode. It's what you would typically run after building the project for deployment.

- **npm run test**
  - This script runs the project's tests. Make sure you've installed the packages before running this script.

**API Documentation**

After starting the API, you can access the documentation at the `/docs` route. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5000/docs](http://localhost:5000/docs) to view the API documentation.

**Additional Notes**

- Refer to the `package.json` file for any additional scripts specific to this project.
- Configuration files (e.g., `.env`) might be required for the project to run properly. Take a look at the `env.sample` file for a guide. Make sure you have them set up according to your environment.
